# Demo-Project
The repo for storing artifacts relevant to the Demo-Project project

Intended purely for learning, the ultimate goal is a website designer, with drag and drop components, data sharing framework, style templates etc.

Minimum intention is to produce a signin page and account page, with full back-end code, with a port to .NET once TS/Node/React is learned.

Current work being done on feature/DP-1 branch.  Pull this.

To run use:
>npm run build

>npm run server

>npm run client (in a separate console)

Please note there is no direct client-server communication yet.
