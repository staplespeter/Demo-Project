# Demo-Project
The repo for storing artifacts relevant to the Demo-Project project

Intended purely for learning, the ultimate goal is a website designer, with drag and drop components, data sharing framework, style templates etc.

Minimum intention is to produce a signin page and account page, with full back-end code, with a port to .NET once TS/Node/React is learned.

Master is operational.  Pull this.  Currently the sign in page will return a token but will not redirect.

>NodeJs & NPM

To run use:
>npm install

>npm run deploy
